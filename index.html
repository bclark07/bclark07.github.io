                    Hello! My name is Brittany Clark and I am thrilled to be learning about computer programming. I tend to be interested in a lot of different things and enjoy taking classes to learn more about my interests. In the past few years I have taken sewing, Spanish, and a Yoga Teacher Training course. I have been interested in computer science since college when I signed up for an introductory computer science class as a requirement for my degree (after the alternative class - logic - kept filling up). I ended up loving it, but ultimately decided not to pursue it after I graduated. Now, 12 years later, I have returned to the classroom to learn about programming (and how much it has changed). 
                </p>
                <p> Currently, I work as a Client Success Manager at Dude Solutions in Cary, NC. I completed my undergraduate degree at Wellesley College where I studied Cognitive Science with a concentration in Computer Science. Since graduating college I worked at 2 different summer camps (one for students with learning disabilities), participated in Americorps in New Orleans, worked at a Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility, and then returned to graduate school where I earned a dual Masters degree in Social Work and Public Adminitration. Afterward I worked for a Managed Care Organization which helps administer Medicaid funds for people with Mental Health diagnoses, and then a year ago, I transitioned to the private sector and started at Dude Solutions. </p>
                <p>I consider myself to be a very extroverted person and love meeting new people and learning about their lives. I also enjoy being outside and hiking. Both of the summer camps I worked at had an emphasis on wilderness exploration and camping. I hope that the new skills I learn in this course will help me to have a positive impact on the lives of others. </p>
